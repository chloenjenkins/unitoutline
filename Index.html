            <h2 class="boxed">Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                Students will develop and apply the skills necessary to design and implement business websites using appropriate
                technologies in this unit. This technology includes using HyperText Markup Language (HTML) to define the
                structure, Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) to determine the look and feel, JavaScript to provide a website's
                behaviour, and other supporting technologies and frameworks to provide for a rich user experience in a business
                context. Students will develop and apply professional skills in a web development environment to identify
                stakeholder requirements and select and implement appropriate technologies for responsive and accessible webbased applications.
            </p>
            <h4>Syllabus</h4>
            <p>
                The study of Web application development; examine web technologies, alternative web development
                methodologies and evaluate various code libraries and tools.
            </p>
            <h4>Unit Learning Outcomes</h4>
            <p>
                All graduates of Curtin University achieve a set of six Graduate Capabilities during their course of study. These
                inform an employer that, through your studies, you have acquired discipline knowledge and a range of other skills
                and capabilities which employers would value in a professional setting. Each unit in your course addresses the
                Graduate Capabilities through a clearly identified set of learning outcomes. They form a vital part in the process
                referred to as assurance of learning. The learning outcomes notify you of what you are expected to know,
                understand or be able to do in order to be successful in this unit. Each assessment for this unit is carefully
                designed to test your knowledge of one or more of the unit learning outcomes. On successfully completing all of
                the assessments you will have achieved all of these learning outcomes.
            </p>
            <p>
                Your course has been designed so that on graduating you will have achieved all of Curtin's Graduate Capabilities
                through the assurance of learning processes in each unit.

            <h4>Learning Activities</h4>
            <p>
                These learning activities in this unit include a mixture of reading, website study, watching videos, quizzes and other
                online activities that enable students to self-test their understanding. Some activities will be story-lined; that is
                must complete one activity before progressing. Students undertake other hands-on activities during weekly
                workshops, interspersed with short lectures. Partial model solutions to some activities will be available on
                Blackboard. Preparatory and workshop activities are on the Blackboard site.

            <h4>Pre-Marking Moderation</h4>
            <p>
                A co-assessor is assigned to this unit to review all assessment tasks and marking criteria/rubrics and monitor and
                confirm the integrity of results. Assessment tasks are provided to students before the assessment task, marking
                criteria are provided to students, assessors are provided with marking guides/rubrics and sufficient information to
                ensure fair and consistent evaluation of student work.

                    <li> Second marking of student work samples near grade boundaries</li>
                    <li>
                        Second marking of borderline student work; or a process of review and validation of decisions where
                        students have not met the pass requirements
                    </li>
                    <li> Analysis of the variances between markers and locations </li>
                    <li> Second marking of a random sample to check for consistent application of marking criteria and standards</li>

                Reasonable Adjustments For Students With Disabilities/Health Circumstances Likely To Impact On
                Studies
            </h4>
            <p>
                A Curtin Access Plan (CAP) is a document that outlines the type and level of support required by a student with a
                disability or health condition to have equitable access to their studies at Curtin. Carers for people with disability
                may also be eligible for support. This support can include alternative exam or test arrangements, study materials
                in accessible formats, access to Curtin's facilities and services or other support as discussed with an advisor from
                AccessAbility Services.
            </p>
            <p>
                Documentation is required from your treating Health Professional to confirm your health circumstances or carer

                misconduct is not involved.
            </p>
            <h4>Academic Misconduct</h4>
            <p>
                Staff members are required to report suspected misconduct. Academic Misconduct means conduct by a student
                that is dishonest or unfair in connection with any academic work. This includes all types of plagiarism, cheating,
                collusion, falsification or fabrication of content, and behaviours like falsifying medical certificates for extension.
                Contract cheating, the use of file sharing, translation services/apps, paraphrasing tools (text-spinners) and
                assignment help websites also may be considered academic misconduct. The longer term personal, social, and
                financial consequences of misconduct can be severe, so please ask for help if you are unsure.
            </p>

            <p>
                If your work is the subject of an inquiry, you will be given an opportunity to respond and appropriate support will
                be provided. Academic work under inquiry will not be graded until the process has concluded. Penalties for
                misconduct may include a warning, a reduced or nil grade, a requirement to repeat the assessment, an annulled
                grade (ANN) or termination from the course. For more information refer to Statute No.10 Student Discipline and
                Academic Misconduct Rules.

            <h4>Student Equity</h4>
            <p>

                assessments to the best of their ability, under standard conditions. These factors may include a disability or
                medical condition (e.g. mental illness, chronic illness, physical or sensory disability, learning disability), significant
                caring responsibilities, pregnancy, religious practices, living in a remote location,or another reason. If you believe
                you may be unfairly disadvantaged on these or other grounds please contact the appropriate service below. It is
                important to note that the staff of the University may not be able to meet your needs if they are not informed of
                your individual circumstances, so please get in touch with the appropriate service if you require assistance.
